This is a friendly fork from http://svn.tls.cena.fr/svn/ivy/ivy-python.

The main goal is to port to newer python version, and in particular to
python3.x (see python3 branch).


Ivy: a lightweight software bus
-------------------------------

Ivy is a lightweight software bus for quick-prototyping protocols. It allows
applications to broadcast information through text messages, with a
subscription mechanism based on regular expressions.


Supported versions of python are: 2.3 and newer

!!! Warning !!!  Version 2.0 broke backward compatibility!  If you're
upgrading from ivy-python 1.x, be sure to read the v2.0 compatibility notes in
ivy/__init__.py (also in: API/index.html)
